# finance-project

This project analyzes Novartis and Walmart through stock and bond valuation, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization. Using methods like P/E Ratio, Dividend Discount Model (DDM), and Yield to Maturity (YTM), we evaluated their market value and financial health. We also assessed their capital structure and calculated WACC to measure financial risk. The project includes portfolio strategies such as Maximum Sharpe Ratio and Minimum Volatility to optimize risk-return balance. Lastly, we analyzed their dividend policies to classify them as value or growth stocks.
